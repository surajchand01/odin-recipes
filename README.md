# odin-recipes
In this project, I built a basic recipe website.In the process of doing so, I used the concept of tags like heading, paragraph, anchor, img, ordered and unordered list tags, along with attributes like href, alt, src, height and width.I also published my work on https://surajchand01.github.io/odin-recipes/
